# Project Title: Tourist Destination Management System

## Description:
The Tourist Destination Management System is a console-based application designed to facilitate the management of tourist destinations, attractions, accommodations, and activities. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tourist destinations and their associated data. The system aims to streamline the process of organizing and accessing information about tourist destinations, providing a convenient platform for travelers and tourism professionals to plan and manage trips effectively.

## Objectives:
1. **Efficient Destination Management**: Develop a system that enables users to efficiently manage information about tourist destinations, including their descriptions, attractions, accommodations, and activities.

2. **User-Friendly Interface**: Create a menu-driven interface that is intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to navigate the system seamlessly and perform desired operations with minimal effort.

3. **Data Integrity and Validation**: Implement robust input handling and validation mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and integrity of data entered by users, preventing errors and inconsistencies in the system.

4. **Enhanced User Experience**: Provide features such as personalized recommendations, interactive maps, and user reviews to enhance the overall user experience and facilitate informed decision-making during trip planning.
